# Introduction
This 'Audit' MVC-ish application is one of the first applications I wrote in NodeJS for Rogers and Brown Customs Brokers. Ther is very little documentation as things were very rushed at the time and I haven't had the time to come back to this. 

That being said, I am hosting this code on GitHub unmodified as a reminder to myself and others of what not to do for a simple data viewing program, no matter how complex the data may or may not be. 

## Moral of the Story?
Always make a seperate constants file and refer to that for your string literals.
Always document your code, taking an extra 5 minutes to do this as you write the code will save you hours later.
If you are going to pick a design Paradigm such as MVC make sure you actually implement it. You will thank yourself later, and so will any co-workers that come after.
